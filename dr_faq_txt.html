        Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone
        call or mouse click away. Our free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with this
        life-threatening illness. By running or walking with us, you can ensure that we are there when people need us. Here
        is how your contribution can help: $15 pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of women who have lost their
        hair from her breast cancer treatment. $50 trains a member of our support network for a year to help improve the
        care of women with breast cancer. $125 covers the cost of counselling sessions to help women cope with the distress
        of their cancer treatment. $250 funds a hospital information station for a year so that people affected by breast
        cancer have easy access to the latest resources and help.</p>
